Especially in the beginning of the project major high level requirements are discussed. It is critical to take security requirements into account during this phase. Security requirements of a system provide really significant inputs during system architecture design phase. In addition to that project cost is also going to be affected by these requirements. Security requirements of a software product can't be discussed at the end of the project. Any project just relies on security tests which will take at the end of the project, is a candidate for failure. Secure software product development needs to be integrated to software development process. I would like to share some practical suggestions based on my experiences. I hope these suggestions will help you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the beginning of the project, try to get security requirements from your stakeholders. If you are lucky your product owner might have some of them. Keep asking questions until you get them.</li>\n<li>A threat and risk analysis (TRA) should take place and outcomes of it need to be addressed by the team. Invite your product owner to TRA discussions.</li>\n<li>A security standard like IEC62443 will keep you on track. It is not realistic to get all security requirements in detail from your stakeholders. Try to understand overall expectations of them and decide which security level you have to achieve in your product. Then try to fulfill these requirements. While you are checking what you need to deliver for reaching aimed security level, you will immediately realize that your job is not easy :)</li>\n<li>After you have your security requirements, add them to your user stories. Be sure security requirements are addressed in your backlog. It is really important to make security requirements visible to all team members. User stories only can be accepted as done when security requirements are also fulfilled. I think that it is not a good idea to implement security requirements after completion of a user story functionally.</li>\n<li>Try to understand how your release date will be affected by your ultimate security level. Prioritization of your security requirements is a good idea. You can reach your ultimate security level step by step by fulfilling security requirements in each release.</li>\n<li>Be aware of vulnerabilities of open source components that you use in your product. Analyze these vulnerabilities effects on your product. Try to apply official fixes as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>A team member can be nominated as product security expert. If your organization does not have such a role officially, I think it is not a problem. As a team you can decide who can take over this responsibility. This role is responsible to drive security related topics in the project. Product security expert needs to be supported with trainings.</li>\n<li>It is not just responsibility of product security expert's responsibility to deliver a secure software product. All team is responsible to make it happen. Security requirements of the product need to be communicated with team members. It is important to understand how security vulnerabilities in a software product can affect company and its customers.</li>\n<li>Team members need to pay attention secure coding principles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Secure Software Product Development - Practical Suggestions</h1>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/secure-software-product-development-practical-fatih-yilmaz/\">LinkedIn</a></em></p>\n<p>Security is a critical aspect of software product development that should be integrated throughout the entire development lifecycle.
